Fix for NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID
It's actually the Subject Alternative Name that's being validated
mmc > Certificates > Personal > Certificates
Find a certificate with a SAN e.g. "IIS Express Development Certificate" has SAN = "DNS name=localhost"
Export this certificate from the Personal folder
Import into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities folder
IIS > Default web site > Bindings > add/edit https
Change the SSL certificate to the one just imported
